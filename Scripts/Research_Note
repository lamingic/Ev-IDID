## research tips:
1.  when use the GA for generating more policy trees,
    the nodes in bottom level of the policy tree have high prob for changing,
    while the top one doesnot.
    But the change of top one has more value for improve the policy of agent i,
    solution: give more weight for the top node in genomes of GA
2.  on how to calculate the diversity of a group of policy trees,
    does it has the property fo sub-module fuction
3.  how to apply the idid model to more agents scenario
4.  how to calculate the contribution of diversity of a policy tree in a group of policy trees
5.  we can delete the arc from node OD to MOD in IDID model

2020-11-28
1.  improve GA for generating more policy trees with high diversity [fitness],
    and considering the weight of level
2.  for calculating the fitness of each individual,
    load the DID model,
    change the D node to chance node,
    import the policy tree,
    set the evidence of initial states as virtual evidence
    find the maximun reward and the belief,that this policy tree can achive
    so, the reward is this policy tree's fitness
