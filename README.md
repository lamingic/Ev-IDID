**Ev-IDID**:
We have developed a sophisticated simulation toolbox exclusively designed for resolving Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagram (I-DID) models. This toolbox expedites the generation of behavioral models within solutions, introducing an automated and efficacious mechanism. Moreover, an accompanying video is incorporated within our repository, providing a vivid visualization of our work. This video is openly accessible on the renowned online video platform Bilibili at [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CZ4y1S7L9/](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CZ4y1S7L9/). Additionally, the codes pertaining to the paper "Ev-IDID: Enhancing Solutions to Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagrams through Evolutionary Algorithms" can be found in our contribution to the 21st International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2022), published online from May 9-13, 2022 (Biyang Ma, Yinghui Pan, Yifeng Zeng, and Zhong Ming.
