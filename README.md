**Ev-IDID**:
We have developed a comprehensive simulation toolbox tailored specifically for solving Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagram (I-DID) models. This toolbox streamlines the process of generating behavioral models in the solutions, providing an automated and efficient approach. Additionally, we have incorporated a supplementary video into our repository, which offers a visual representation of our work. This video is also publicly accessible on the online video platform Bilibili at [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CZ4y1S7L9/](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CZ4y1S7L9/).

**SI-IDID**:
Building upon the Ev-IDID toolkit, we introduce SI-IDID, a novel solution methodology for solving I-DID problems. SI-IDID leverages the robust features of the Ev-IDID toolbox and enhances its capabilities, offering a refined approach to tackle I-DID models. For comprehensive access to all the implementations and datasets used in our SI-IDID framework, please refer to our dedicated GitHub repository at [https://github.com/lamingic/SI-IDID](https://github.com/lamingic/SI-IDID). This repository serves as a comprehensive resource, housing the code, data, and documentation necessary to reproduce and extend our work.
