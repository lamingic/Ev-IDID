**Project Outlines**:

**Ev-IDID**:
We have developed a sophisticated simulation toolbox exclusively designed for resolving Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagram (I-DID) models. This toolbox expedites the generation of behavioral models within solutions, introducing an automated and efficacious mechanism. Moreover, an accompanying video is incorporated within our repository, providing a vivid visualization of our work. This video is openly accessible on the renowned online video platform Bilibili at [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CZ4y1S7L9/](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CZ4y1S7L9/). Additionally, the codes pertaining to the paper "Ev-IDID: Enhancing Solutions to Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagrams through Evolutionary Algorithms" can be found in our contribution to the 21st International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2022), published online from May 9-13, 2022 (Biyang Ma, Yinghui Pan, Yifeng Zeng, and Zhong Ming.

**SI-IDID**:
Extending the functionalities of the Ev-IDID toolkit, we introduce SI-IDID, a novel solution methodology specifically tailored for tackling I-DID problems. SI-IDID builds upon the robust foundations of Ev-IDID, refining and augmenting its capabilities to offer an enhanced approach to I-DID modeling. For exhaustive access to all implementations, datasets, and related resources utilized within our SI-IDID framework, please refer to our dedicated GitHub repository located at [https://github.com/lamingic/SI-IDID](https://github.com/lamingic/SI-IDID). This repository functions as a comprehensive resource center, encompassing code, data, and thorough documentation essential for reproducing and extending our research. Furthermore, it serves as supplemental material for our paper titled "Improved Response Strategies for Unknown Behaviours in Multiagent Interaction," authored by Yinghui Pan (Member, IEEE), Mengen Zhou, Yifeng Zeng (Member, IEEE), Biyang Ma (Member, IEEE), Yew-soon Ong (Fellow, IEEE), and Guoquan Liu.
