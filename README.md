**Ev-IDID**:
We have developed a sophisticated simulation toolbox exclusively designed for resolving Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagram (I-DID) models. This toolbox expedites the generation of behavioral models within solutions, introducing an automated and efficacious mechanism. Moreover, an accompanying video is incorporated within our repository, providing a vivid visualization of our work. This video is openly accessible on the renowned online video platform Bilibili at [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CZ4y1S7L9/](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CZ4y1S7L9/). Additionally, the codes pertaining to the paper "Ev-IDID: Enhancing Solutions to Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagrams through Evolutionary Algorithms" can be found in our contribution to the 21st International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2022), published online from May 9-13, 2022 (Biyang Ma, Yinghui Pan, Yifeng Zeng, and Zhong Ming.

**SI-IDID**

SI-IDID, an extension of the Ev-IDID toolkit, introduces a novel solution tailored for addressing I-DID problems. Building on the robust foundations of Ev-IDID, SI-IDID refines and augments its capabilities, offering an enhanced approach to I-DID modeling. For comprehensive access to all implementations, datasets, and essential resources related to the SI-IDID framework, please visit our dedicated GitHub repository at https://github.com/lamingic/SI-IDID. This repository serves as a one-stop resource hub, encompassing detailed code, datasets, figures, tables, photographs, simulation results, analytical insights, and experimental setups. It is also intended as supplementary material for our paper, "Improved Response Strategies for Unknown Behaviours in Multiagent Interaction," authored by Yinghui Pan (IEEE Member), Mengen Zhou, Yifeng Zeng (IEEE Member), Biyang Ma (IEEE Member), Yew-soon Ong (IEEE Fellow), and Guoquan Liu. Here, you will find all the necessary components to replicate and extend our research.
